## 📖 Project Overview  
This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.  
It is a simple recipe website built in two phases:  

1. **Phase 1 – HTML only:**  
   - Created multiple recipe pages using only HTML.  
   - Practiced basic tags such as headings (`h1`–`h3`), paragraphs, images, links, and lists.  
   - Set up project structure with an `index.html` as the homepage.  

2. **Phase 2 – Adding CSS styling:**  
   - Applied custom styles with an external CSS stylesheet.  
   - Used universal selector `*` for default styles.  
   - Centered images using `display: block; margin: auto;`.  
   - Added background colors, text alignment, text decoration, and custom colors.  
   - Improved readability and presentation of the recipe site.

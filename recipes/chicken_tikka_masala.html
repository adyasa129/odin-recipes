    <h2>Instructions</h2>  
    <h3>Chicken Tikka:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients except chicken in a bowl and mix. Add chicken and turn well to coat.</li>  
        <li>Cover with cling wrap and leave in fridge to marinate overnight (3 hours minimum).</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a non stick pan over high heat until smoking. Add half the chicken and spread out. Leave for 2 minutes or until charred. Turn each piece and cook the other side until charred – don’t worry if not cooked inside. Remove into bowl.</li>
        <li>Scrape out charred bits left in pan and discard. Add more oil if required and cook remaining chicken.</li>
    </ol> 
    <h3>Sauce:</h3>  
    <ol>
        <li>Wipe skillet with paper towels (or do this part in a pot as you need a lid). Turn heat down to medium high.</li>
        <li>Add oil and butter. When butter is melted, add onions, ginger and salt.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring constantly to ensure it doesn’t burn, until the ginger is starting to turn golden and the onions smell sweet, about 5 – 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the garlic and paprika, and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the Curry Sauce Spices, and cook a further 2 minutes, stirring.</li> 
        <li>Add tomato passata and water, and mix. Bring to a simmer, then cover and reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Pour curry into a bowl, then use a stick blender to puree until smooth </li>
        <li>Return sauce to skillet. Add cream, sugar and butter. Stir to melt the butter.</li>
        <li>Add chicken, stir. Simmer for a few minutes until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Optional: Sprinkle with a pinch of extra garam masala at the end.</li>
        <li>Serve over <em>basmati rice, </em> sprinkled with coriander/cilantro if desired. Try this No Yeast Flatbread as a <em>quick naan!</em></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Enjoy!</h3>

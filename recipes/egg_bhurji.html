    <!-- Egg Bhurji is a popular Indian dish made with scrambled eggs, spices-->
    <p class= "mo">Egg Bhurji aka Anda Bhurji. An Indian take on scrambled eggs. This recipe is precise yet adaptable, balanced in seasoning, and addictive in texture. Perfect for a simple but elevated breakfast or brunch. Tested to perfection!</p>
    <p>Bhurji means scramble, so Egg or Anda Bhurji is just scrambled eggs flavored with aromatics and spices.I grew up with Desi-style omelets, which are more like frittatas in that you whisk the vegetables into the eggs. I was less aware of this spicier, less uniform version.The first time I had a memorable Egg Bhurji was when my mom made it. Herâ€™s featured an extra dose of subtly sweet onions and crunchy green chilies. Everything about its warmth and texture reminded me of what I love about Desi food. It was just scrambled eggs, but a lot more addictive. So here is my version, inspired by my mother's.</p>
